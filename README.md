## Overview

This project demonstrates how to classify income levels using a Random Forest classifier built on a fictional dataset. The analysis is broken down into several key steps:

- **Data Investigation:** The script begins by checking the income distribution and cleaning up extra spaces in categorical columns.
- **Baseline Model:** A Random Forest model is built and evaluated to serve as a baseline for income prediction.
- **Tuning:** The model is tuned by varying the `max_depth` parameter to find the best performing depth based on test accuracy.
- **Feature Importance:** Once tuned, the modelâ€™s most influential features are identified.
- **Feature Engineering:** A new feature (`education_bin`) is created to group education levels into three categories, and the model is re-tuned with the extended feature set to see if performance improves.
